              <h2><b>Stong Pond</b></h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Stng.jpg" alt=""></span>Stong Pond named after Jacob Stong, (a settler in the early 1800s whose former property is now the land known as York’s Keele campus) is what is referred to as a storm water pond. Its role is to retain storm water to prevent floods from occurring.</p>
              <br>
              <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/stng2.jpg" alt=""></span><b>Significance:</b>Stong Pond not only acts as a storm water drain but also serves other functions. 
                It acts as an ecosystem for diverse species as well as offers a place for York students to unwind and immerse themselves in nature. 
                Being environmental studies student we have the opportunity to take full advantage of this space not only because the pond is close to the Health Nursing and Environmental Studies 
                building but because we get the opportunity to learn of the various species and ecological systems that are present in Stong pond through the hands-on courses offered in the program. 
                Giving us a deeper understanding and a stronger connection to the area. For you avid selfie and photo enthusiasts, did I mention how beautiful the view of the sunset is 
                from the various benches that could be found around the pond. You can never go wrong with a little sunlight in the background lighting up those angles.</p>
              <br>
              <b>Boynton Woodlot</b>
              <ul>
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Bton.jpg" alt=""></span>Found on the south corner of the Keele Campus, Boynton Woods is one of the Woodlots ENVS students make use of. In the first year of the program, 
                  students are required to take ENVS 1500 (Introduction to Environmental Science), an environmental Studies course that incorporates field work in its curriculum. 
                  Within the Woodlots, students get the opportunity to research and conduct coursework on the various flora and fauna found within Boynton, 
                  giving students hands on experience of what it would be like to be an environmental scientist, and the methods they would employ. 
                  The course often proves difficult for some students, but with the resources available in the faculty such as the peer mentors, the difficulties it presents are often reduced.</p>
              <br>
                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/boyer.jpg" alt=""></span>Located on the North West corner of Keele Campus, Boyer Woods is another woodlot ENVS students make use of. Together with Osgoode Woodlot Boyer is considered a Natural Heritage System.</p>
              <br>
                <b>W.P. Scott Library</b>
                <ul>
                  <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Sctt.jpg" alt=""></span>Named after William Pearson Scott, the second chairman of the Board of Governors at York University, the William Pearson Scott Library (simply referred to as “Scott Library” or “Scott”) is one of the five main libraries at York. It is where students can find materials, services, research assistance for their various study areas and also where many often choose to study.</p>
               <br>
                   <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/sctt2.jpg" alt=""></span><b>Signficance:</b>Scott Library with its various spaces attracts many students looking for a place to study, research and work on projects and assignments. 
                     There are tons of work benches and cubicles scattered throughout the five floors of the library giving students ample study spaces to choose from. 
                     Students often gravitate to the second floor as they can find a mix of table, counter and lounge seating areas as well as silent and open spaces that cater to students’ study 
                     preferences. As students in FES we benefit greatly from the various resources offered at the library. 
                     The faculty has its own subject librarian who assists students with starting off their research or with finding a specific resource. This is a great help for students as it is 
                     often difficult navigating the various databases (such as JSTOR and EBSCOhost) that they would need to use to find journals and research materials.</p>
