                <u>Getting GPS data into a GIS</u>
                <ul>
                  2 ways you can bring GPS coordinates into a GIS:
                  <ol>
												<li>Take GPS receiver into the field, write down the coordinates and why relevant 
                          info (attributes) you’re interested in, go back to the office and enter the coordinates/attributes 
                          into a text editor or spreadsheet software to create a table, import the file into the GIS. 
                          This is <b>not</b> the preferred method.</li>
												<li>Using a GPS receiver that includes a data logger, capture locations and attributes while in the field, 
                          transfer the GPS information to a computer, import to the GIS</li>
											</ol>
                  .</p>
              <ul>
							<p>Receivers that facilitate an automated approach will cost more but are worth it, and often necessary, 
                if using GPS for GIS data collection.  
              <br>
                <b>Receiver Examples</b>
                <ul>
                <li>The GeoXM model will provide 1-3m accuracy and cost about $2000, 
                  the more sophisticated model GeoXH provides 30cm accuracy and costs around $6000. 
                 ESRI's Arcpad software can be loaded onto these devices, allowing you to create shapefiles during data collection.
                 <ul>
                   When it comes to Datum and Projection its important to know whatdaturm and projection were defined in the settings when the
                   GPSS unit was used to collect data.
                <li>GPS data managers will have difficulty if GPS data isn’t documented properly and 
                  issues will occur if the data is meant to be shared with others.
                  <ul>
                  <b>Mobile GPS</b>
                    <ul>
                <li>Some GPS receivers allow you to upload GIS data directly onto the unit, 
                  providing valuable reference information when out in the field. 
                  - Software like ESRI's <b>ArcPad</b> facilitates this. 
                 <br>
                  <b>Preparation is the key</b>
                What to keep in mind when undertaking GPS field reconnaissance:
                      <li><b>Mission plan</b> - check sateelite status and availability beforehand
                        to head out at optimal time for collecting GPS data
                      <li>Design a data dictionary before going out to collect data
                      <li>Careful of how much data is loaded into receiver before going out
                      <li>Assess the equipment before using it for project (is it an LCD screen which would make it hard to see
                <br>
                        <b>A Data Dictionary</b>     
                      <li>List all files in a database and the names and types of each field
                      <li>Provide valuable system documentation which in turn makes it easier for data managers, data users, and application 
                        programmers to ultimately make use of the data
                      <li>Implementing data standards into a data dictionary is how you succeed in data collection for an organization
                   <ul>
                     To create a data dictionary:
                    <ol>
												<li>Make a list of involved geographic features</li>
												<li>Identify attributes you wish to record for each feature</li>
												<li>Create the data dictionary</li>
												<li>Test your design</li>
											</ol>
